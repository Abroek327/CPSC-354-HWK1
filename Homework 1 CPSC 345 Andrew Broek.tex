(not too sure on the formatting but here is the raw code for my assignment)
--A program to run GCD
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -Wno-overlapping-patterns #-}

egcd:: Int->Int->Int 
a :: Integer
a = 872
b :: Integer
b = 315
egcd a b = a-b
egcd a b =
    if a>b
        then egcd (a-b) b
    else
       egcd a (b-a)
egcd a 0 = a
 
First is the declaration of egcd where it has three type signatures Int->Int->Int; two for input and one for output
The program then works by defining how it's base function is to subtract a and b but if a>b then it needs to subtract b from a before recursively calling itself. The same logic applies for if b>a (in that case a has to be subtracted from b) and finally the exit condition of when b is 0 a is the final result.
